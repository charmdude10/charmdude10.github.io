      <div class="title1">Chicken</div>
      <p>
        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        India.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl,
        and
        green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel.
        A
        male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is
        called
        a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
        Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated
        for
        meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

      <div class="title2">Beef</div>
      <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are
        often
        used
        for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as
        found
        in
        most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high
        consumption
        is
        associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed.
        Beef
        has a
        high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of
        any
        agricultural product.</p>

      <div class="title3">Sushi</div>
      <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice,
        usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood — often raw — and
        vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also
        referred
        to as shari, or sumeshi.
